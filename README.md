#### Successive sessions of MLBstatTrax will bring the  data current
#### The .csv data file generated by MLBstatTrax is at your disposal for any purpose you wish, for example, aggregating statistics for an entire season

### 2. Effortlessly build powerful and intuitive graphs
#### Graphs can be easily customized to focus on the stats you care about for any or all seasons
#### Graphs will update themselves automatically using the latest data
